# DQ-AI



This "AI" results of jealousis.
Some of my friends were playing a mobile game nammed "Duel Quiz" which is a game based on questions on overall knowledge.

After a while, I start playing with them. But after loosing some games...
I conclude these defeats were because the game was bad designed... And not for any other reasons!

But I could find a way to be sure to win and it's where this program come.
This program is not at 100% finished... All the functions are done and work perfectly fine, but you need to let it run to save all the questions and its right answer.

But this will take a long amount of time... About 30 nights of 8 hours...
So I give up this idea.

I could also, rather than save all the answers, look for the right answer on the internet. This seems to be a good idea, but I couldn't find the time to implement it.



Any way, if you want to try it, contact me (guillaume1.thomas@protonmail.com), because you need a special configuration
