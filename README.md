# DQ-AI



This "AI" results of jealousis.
Some of my friends were playing a mobile game nammed "Duel Quiz" which is a game based on questions on overall knowledge.

After a while, I start playing with them. But I was loosing...
I conclude these defeats were because the game was bad designed... And not for any other reasons!

But I could find a way to be sure to win and it's where this program come.

First I look for an API. But it's a little so it doesn't have one...
Things get harder...

So here is how I build this program :
The idea is simple, I want to create a file with all the questions and their corresponding right answer. If in a game, I have a question I have already met, I can answer correctly thanks to this file. If not, I save it and I will correctly answer it the next time.

The main challenge here is to allow the program to interact with the game while there is no API. So I download an emulator for Android on my laptop. I used an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) find on a github to capture questions and answers. And we are done!

It is properly working. But I underestimate one factor...
The time needed to save all the questions is HUGE!

Duel Quiz has about 30,000 different questions. 
I figure out that to save all these questions, I will need something around 30 nights of 8 hours...

This is definitively too long for me.
So I give up this idea.

I could also, rather than save all the answers, look for the right answer on the internet. This seems to be a good idea, but I couldn't have found time to implement it yet.

So, to conlude, this program is finished... All the functions are done and work perfectly fine, but you need to let it run to save all the questions and its right answer. I won't  do it.

But any way, if you want to try it, contact me (guillaume1.thomas@protonmail.com), and I will explain you the set up you need to make it work

Thanks for your attention
